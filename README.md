Project #1: Tic Tac Toe Game

This game follows the traditional logic of tic-tac-toe and allows users to keep score if they choose to play multiple games. The code for the game is made up of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using jQuery to interact with the DOM. The HTML file (index.html) includes a link to the stylesheet (style.css) as well as to two JavaScript files (game-logic.js, and tictactoe.js) that separate pieces of the working code by their purpose. Game-logic.js includes functions and variables relevant to the rules of tic tac toe game play, while tictactoe.js is the main JavaScript file that brings together the elements necessary for game play and user interface.



This game was created as my first project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. My approach to creating this game began with simple wireframes (https://moqups.com/tiffboors29/n0Rrhsc8) and user stories (https://moqups.com/tiffboors29/uHxUgx1G), from which my HTML/CSS and JavaScript code developed. My tic tac toe board is made up of tiles that when clicked, change to either x or o tiles depending on which player clicked them. Creating a wins counter, I implemented the ability to play multiple rounds with the same opponent and track the score. I had planned to implement a 1-player mode where the user could play against the computer, but have not yet completed this function. I would like to add that feature as well as add the ability for users to play against each other from different devices. These are unsolved aspects that I plan to continue working on.
