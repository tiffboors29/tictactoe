Project #1: Tic Tac Toe Game

This game follows the traditional logic of tic-tac-toe, but gives users the following options: two players playing against each other on the same device, two players playing against each other from different devices, or one player playing against the computer. The code for the game is made up of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using jQuery and AJAX to interact with the DOM. The HTML file (index.html) includes a link to the stylesheet (style.css) as well as to three JavaScript files (activity.js, game-logic.js, and tictactoe.js) that separate pieces of the working code by their purpose. Game-logic.js includes functions and variables relevant to the rules of tic tac toe game play. Activity.js includes functions pertaining to user activity and interactivity with the DOM. Tictactoe.js is the main JavaScript file that brings together the elements neccessary for game play.



This game was created as my first project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. My approach to creating this game began with simple wireframes ((link)) and user stories ((link)), from which my HTML/CSS and JavaScript code developed. building a tic tac toe board made up of tiles that when clicked, would change to either x or o tiles depending on which player clicked them. Creating a wins counter, I implemented the ability to play multiple rounds with the same opponent and track the score. ((((unsolved problems?...technology used))))
